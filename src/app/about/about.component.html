  <font size="4">The Diversity Research Symposium (DRS) was co-founded in 2009 by Linh Nguyen Littleford (Associate Professor in the Department of Psychological Science) and Charles R. Payne (former Assistant Provost for Diversity, former Director of the Office of Institutional Diversity, and Professor of Secondary Education), both at Ball State University. The DRS aims to:</font><ul><li><font size="4">provide an educational environment in which faculty, staff, community members, and students from all disciplines who are interested in cultural diversity issues can learn, interact, share ideas, and network with one another.</font></li><li><font size="4">encourage members of academic institutions to infuse cultural diversity issues into their research, curricula, and professional development. &nbsp;</font></li></ul><font size="4"><br><strong><em>Organizing and hosting responsibilities are rotated every year among three universities (Ball State University,</em></strong><strong><em>&nbsp;Indiana State University, and&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>Indiana University Southeast). In selecting the symposium's theme, keynote speakers, and activities, the organizers highlight the diversity-related values and objectives at their respective institutions while achieving the goals of the DRS.&nbsp;</em></strong><br><br><strong><em>The 2017 DRS will be our 9th annual conference and the fourth one hosted by Ball State University.&nbsp;</em></strong><br><br>Ball State University's Office of the Vice President for Academic Affairs and the Office of Institutional Diversity provided financial support to host the 2009, 2011, and 2014 DRS. We are grateful to Dr. Terry King, Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs, for his continued encouragement and support of the DRS.<strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></font><br><br>

        <h4>Diversity Research Symposium: From Research to Action</h4>
        Hosted by Ball State University
        <p>A committee of 13 members from diverse disciplines conducted a blind review of the 100 submitted proposals. Proposal authors represented 27 universities and organizations, 8 U.S. states and 2 countries (U.S. & Canada). Most of the authors were faculty members (n=52) and graduate students (n=24), with some undergraduate students (n=10), staff members (n=10), and a few community member (n=1), and others (n=4). The acceptance rate was 39%.  In our final symposium program, we had 26 talks and 10 posters, in addition to four invited presentations, a play, and a dance. A total of 217 participants pre-registered for the symposium, representing 13 U.S. States, 21 institutions and 81 academic sub-disciplines. We had five external sponsors and 11 internal sponsors.</p>
